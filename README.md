The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. A datatable was created and the data cleaned and sorted with some feature engineering conducted in order to move forward with pivot tables and visualisations.

Initial pivot table breaks down sales by year, quarter and month for each of the 3 years the data spans. Slicers are created here which will later enable interaction with the dashboard.
